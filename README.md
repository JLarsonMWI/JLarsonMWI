**`🎯 Software Sharpshooter`**

As a Software Engineer at Midwestern Interactive, I craft bespoke digital experiences that bridge the gap between businesses and cutting-edge web technology. My approach is holistic, starting from the kernel of an idea to the final stroke of code, ensuring each project not only meets but exceeds the unique demands of my clients—or my own creative quests.

In the realm of web development, my mission is twofold: to catapult businesses into the digital forefront and enrich individuals’ online presence. This journey is fueled by a passion for integrating the latest tech innovations in a way that’s both accessible and transformative.

At the core of my professional ethos is a simple, yet profound belief: the golden rule of reciprocity. Whether it’s clients, colleagues, or companions, I engage with all on a foundation of mutual respect and the anticipation of shared success.

Let’s weave the web of tomorrow, together.

 <summary><h3>🚨 John's Coding Journey 🚨</h3></summary>

  Embarking on my coding odyssey in the collegiate realm, I honed the art of webcraft with the foundational tools of HTML and CSS, creating responsive websites that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The discovery of JavaScript in an academic setting propelled me into the world of interactive in-browser gaming, enhancing my sites with dynamic features.
  
  My technical voyage evolved with Java, where I engineered and refined Minecraft plugins, streamlining server management and enhancing gameplay. In 2013, I ventured into the professional sphere, leveraging my expertise to unveil hidden opportunities within my organization, contributing to .NET e-commerce solutions, and expanding my horizons in digital commerce.
  
  The freelance frontier beckoned in 2014, leading me to architect applications and websites for diverse businesses, thus becoming the start of my private web development business - GreatIdea.dev. My toolkit expanded with JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress, culminating in the creation and stewardship of an online sports journalism venture, South MS Sports (2013-2018).
  
  As a Network Engineer, I continued to elevate my craft from 2017 to 2021, applying my growing skill set to contract endeavors. My reentry into professional web development was marked by the stewardship of over 65 client websites for the Managed IT Services company at which I worked, where I infused my knowledge of React and modern web technologies into active development projects. I soon found a new position as a Senior Fullstack Developer with a digital marketing agency in my hometown, and that strengthened my knowledge and growth with PHP-based websites and web applications, serving over 200 clients with both frontend and backend solutions.
  
  In 2022, I finally found my professional sanctuary at Midwestern Interactive, where my passion for software development is not only nurtured, but thrives. I spend most of my time outside of work by contributing with GreatIdea.dev, where I service smaller clients local to Mississippi by architecting and shipping websites and applications that meet their business needs. My current personal pursuits include devising scalable backend APIs, concocting a digital cookbook to safeguard treasured family recipes, and developing pragmatic applications in Go and Python, most recently through developing an RPG Manager.
  
  Beyond the digital landscape, I find solace in the embrace of nature, indulging in hiking, camping, and survival. I am an avid firearms enthusiast, pushing myself to master the art of marksmanship and the intricacies of firearm maintenance. I find myself most attracted to hobbies which scratch my problem-solving itch, and I am always on the lookout for new challenges to conquer.
